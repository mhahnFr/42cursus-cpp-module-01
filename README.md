## Welcome to 42cursus-cpp-module-01!
This project is the second project featuring C++ at the [42 school].

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn some other very basic principles of object-orientied programming using C++.
It lets the students discover function pointers, getters and setters, file reading and writing and ``switch``-statements.

- In the first exercise, the difference between objects on the heap and on the stack are shown.
- In the second exercise, allocated arrays are demonstrated.
- In the third exercise the differences between pointers and references are shown.
- The forth exercise goes even deeper into that topic.
- The fifth exercise features a small replacement utility. Usage: ``./sed++ <file> <text> <replacement>``. It showcases
the basic file input and output streams.
- The sixth exercise features function pointers in C++.
- And in the final, seventh exercise, ``switch`` blocks are introduced.
